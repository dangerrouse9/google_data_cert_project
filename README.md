# google_data_cert_project
Repository for files used in Google Data Analyst Certificate Capstone Project.

The primary documents of concern in this repository are capstone_report.pdf, case_study_prompt.pdf, and fitabase_daily_data_final.xlsx

case_study.pdf is the case study provided for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project and capstone_report.pdf is the final report.  The report covers everything from the problem to be solved (How can smart device data better inform Bellabeat's future marketing campaigns?) up to recommendations for the marketing department.  Within the appendix you will also find links to data sources, data cleaning change logs, and logs of analysis performed in Google Sheets and in BigQuery using SQL.  All R code used for the analysis is in the report in code chunks, most of which have accompanying graphics.

fitabase_daily_data_final.xlxs is the final version of the Google Sheet used for cleaning and analysis.  It has all of the daily data merged into one sheet, as well as some pivot tables that display daily data analysis findings.
